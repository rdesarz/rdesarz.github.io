• Designed and implemented an obstacle-avoidance trajectory planner using Bézier curves and numerical optimization, deployed in RTMaps for real-time operation
• Researched and benchmarked planning and tracking methods (RRT, graph search, lattice, MPC) for autonomous shuttle navigation
• Enhanced velocity management by extending a Model Predictive Control (MPC)–based velocity control module
• Developed and integrated state machines for vehicle behavior sequencing (stop, yield, overtake), ensuring safe and consistent decision-making
