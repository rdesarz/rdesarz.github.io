## Project Overview

Contributed to the development of planning and control systems for Navya's autonomous shuttles, which operate in mixed traffic environments including pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. The work focused on creating robust, safe, and comfortable navigation capabilities for public transportation scenarios.

## Key Contributions

### Obstacle-Avoidance Trajectory Planning
- Designed and implemented a real-time trajectory planner using **Bézier curves** for smooth path generation
- Applied **numerical optimization** techniques to generate collision-free paths around dynamic obstacles
- Integrated the planner into **RTMaps** middleware for real-time deployment on the vehicle
- Achieved sub-100ms planning cycles while maintaining passenger comfort constraints

### Planning & Tracking Research
- Conducted comprehensive benchmarking of motion planning algorithms:
  - **Sampling-based methods**: RRT, RRT* variants
  - **Graph search**: A*, D* Lite for structured environments
  - **Lattice planners**: State-lattice for kinematic feasibility
  - **Model Predictive Control**: Trajectory tracking and optimization
- Evaluated trade-offs between computational efficiency, path quality, and real-time performance
- Provided technical recommendations for production deployment

### Model Predictive Control Enhancement
- Extended the **MPC-based velocity control module** for improved speed management
- Implemented predictive horizon optimization for smoother acceleration/deceleration profiles
- Integrated comfort constraints (jerk limits, lateral acceleration bounds)
- Improved energy efficiency through optimized velocity planning

## Technologies Used

- **C++** - Real-time control implementation
- **RTMaps** - Robotics middleware for sensor fusion and control
- **MPC** - Model Predictive Control for trajectory tracking
- **Numerical optimization** - Path planning and trajectory generation
- **Python** - Analysis, simulation, and benchmarking
