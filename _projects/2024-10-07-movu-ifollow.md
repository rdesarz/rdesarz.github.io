Second experience

• Designed and deployed ROS2 navigation stack components (path planner, controllers, custom plugins) to enhance AMR safety and reliability in warehouse operations.
• Developed high-performance C++ libraries for trajectory representation and velocity control, boosting throughput beyond manual forklift benchmarks.
• Established release processes, CI/CD pipelines, and code quality standards adopted across the robotics team.
• Supervised a master’s intern on leader–follower navigation algorithms, driving results from simulation to implementation.

First experience

• Collaborated with an early startup team to develop the first prototype of a logistics AMR for warehouse cart transport. 
• Took end-to-end responsibility for core robotics software, focusing on low-level sensing and high-level planning. 
• Implemented odometry and localization using 2D LiDAR and inertial sensors in C++/ROS. 
• Designed a trajectory planning and synchronization algorithm for multi-robot fleet coordination.
