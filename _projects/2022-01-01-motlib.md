A C++ library implementing multiple object tracking algorithms based on Random Finite Set (RFS) theory, including the Gaussian Mixture Probability Hypothesis Density (GM-PHD) filter.

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/rdesarz/motlib){: .btn .btn--primary}

## Features

- **GM-PHD Filter**: Gaussian Mixture implementation of the PHD filter for multi-target tracking
- **Birth/Death modeling**: Handles target spawning and disappearance
- **Clutter management**: Robust to false detections and missed observations
- **Track extraction**: Automatic track management and pruning
- **Flexible interface**: Supports various motion and measurement models

## Technologies

- **C++17** - Core implementation
- **Eigen** - Matrix operations and linear algebra
- **CMake** - Build system

## Applications

Suitable for:
- Radar tracking
- Video surveillance
- Autonomous vehicle perception
- Multi-robot tracking
