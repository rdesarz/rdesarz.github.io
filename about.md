# Romain Desarzens
------------------

I studied robotics at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and I currently work on building autonomous vehicle at [Navya](https://navya.tech/en/) in the motion planning and control team. I mostly work with C++ and Python, but I enjoy learning new languages such as Rust. I am also curious about applying machine learning to the field of robotics and I am currently improving my knowledge in reinforcement learning.
