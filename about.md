# Romain Desarzens
------------------

I studied robotics at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and worked for 5 years in the field of mobile robotics. I worked on motion planning for autonomous vehicle at [Navya](https://navya.tech/en/). I currently work at iFollow where I develop trajectory generation for warehouse robotics. I mostly work with C++ and Python, but I enjoy learning new languages such as Rust. I am also curious about applying machine learning to the field of robotics and I am currently improving my knowledge in reinforcement learning.
