# About Me
------------------

Hi, Iâ€™m **Romain Desarzens**, a senior robotics software engineer at **Movu Robotics**. I specialize in motion planning and control for autonomous mobile robots, with a focus on building robust, real-time systems tailored for dynamic industrial environments.

I studied at **EPFL**, where I built a strong foundation in robotics, control systems, and applied mathematics. Since then, Iâ€™ve been working at the intersection of high-level planning and low-level controlâ€”developing **ROS-based frameworks** and custom algorithms for real-world deployment.

I'm proficient in **C++**, **Python**, and **Rust**, and I take pride in writing clean, efficient, and maintainable codeâ€”whether itâ€™s for high-performance path planning, systems integration, or tooling and automation.

From trajectory generation to smooth path following, I enjoy designing motion solutions that are both mathematically rigorous and field-proven.

This blog is where I share selected projects and explore the technical challenges of autonomy, with an emphasis on **motion planning**, **control strategies**, and **software architecture**.
