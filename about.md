# Romain Desarzens
------------------

I am a robotics engineer with 8 years of experience in mobile robotics.  
After studying robotics at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), I worked on motion planning for autonomous vehicles at [Navya](https://navya.tech/en/).  
I now develop trajectory generation algorithms for warehouse robots at [Movu Robotics](https://www.movu-robotics.com/fr).  

My main tools are C++ and Python, and I am exploring Rust for control and systems programming. I am also expanding my knowledge in reinforcement learning and its applications to robotics.
