<p class="page__lead">Hi, I'm Romain, a robotics software engineer passionate about bringing robots to life through intelligent control systems and autonomous behaviors.</p>

<p>I specialize in <strong>biped locomotion</strong>, <strong>motion planning</strong>, and <strong>real-time control algorithms</strong>. My work spans the full stack from mathematical modeling and optimal control theory to practical implementation in C++, Python, and Rust. Whether it's generating stable walking gaits for humanoid robots or designing path planning algorithms for autonomous systems, I focus on bridging the gap between theory and real-world robotics applications.</p>

<p>Below are some of my projects exploring control systems, computer vision, and embedded systems for robotics.</p>
