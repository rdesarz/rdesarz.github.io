I'm a robotics software engineer who builds autonomous systems from mathematical foundations to production deployment. My work spans the full robotics stack—from sensor fusion and localization to motion planning and fleet coordination.

I've contributed to autonomous shuttles navigating urban streets, warehouse robots optimizing logistics operations, and biped controllers generating stable walking gaits. Whether it's implementing preview control for humanoid locomotion or deploying ROS2 navigation stacks in production warehouses, I focus on creating robust, real-world robotics systems.

## Experience Highlights
